Title: SEO Article Writing Guidelines 

Dear Mrs. Writer, 

When crafting an SEO-friendly article, please adhere to the following guidelines: 

1. **Use Headings**: Structure your article using headings. The main title should be an H1 heading, with subsequent headings being H2, H3, and so on. These headings should provide an overview of each section of your article. 

2. **Keyword Usage**: Use the provided keywords in a natural and meaningful way throughout the article. They should appear in the title, the first paragraph, and a few times in the body of the text. However, avoid keyword stuffing - the text should always read naturally. 

3. **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent style, tone, and quality throughout the article. This helps to engage the reader and make your content more enjoyable to read. 

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim to provide a comprehensive answer to the topic at hand. Understand the topic thoroughly and craft a narrative that covers it in depth. 

5. **Text-Rich Content**: Your content should be text-rich. If possible, include references to other relevant topics. These references should make sense in the context of the article. 

6. **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on the quality of your content. It should be well-written, engaging, and provide value to the reader. 

7. **Content Structure**: Your article should have a clear structure, including an introduction that outlines what the article will cover, a body that delves into the topic in detail, and a conclusion that summarizes the main points. 

Remember, the goal is to create an article that is not only SEO-friendly but also engaging and valuable to the reader. Good luck! 

Best,
Mr. Editor
